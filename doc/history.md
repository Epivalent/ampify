History
=======

**2010-01-17**

* Sean B. Palmer wrote the very first public article about Ampify: "[Ampify, a
  Social Publishing System](http://inamidst.com/stuff/esp/ampify)".

**2010-01-12**

* Prompted by Sean B. Palmer's questioning of [App Engine's
  limitations](http://www.espians.com/why-app-engine-is-not-appropriate-for-bootstrap.html),
  Tav abandoned its use as the backend and decided to use Go instead.

**2010-01-06**

* The idea was
  [explained](http://www.openideaproject.org/irclogs/browse/esp/2010/01/06)
  relatively cogently for the very first time and was received positively. With
  inspiration from Sofia Bustamante, Sean B. Palmer came up with the name
  "Ampify" for the project and the domain `ampify.it` was promptly registered.

* Development officially started with a public [Ampify
  repository](http://github.com/tav/ampify) on GitHub.

**Late 2009**

* Discussions between James Arthur and Tav concerning the [Espra
  Trustmap](http://www.trustmap.org) service they'd been working on led to
  insights about the requirements for a scalable platform.

* With lots and lots of help from David Pinto, Mamading Cessay, Sofia Bustamante
  and eventually Yan Minagawa, much of the general architecture (for both the
  backend and the user interface) of the platform was gradually worked out.

**2009-08-18**

* With help from David Pinto, Tav coded a prototype version of the collaboration
  platform called [Tent](http://tent.espians.com). It added micro syntax and
  structured search to facilitate collaboration over IRC.

**2009-08-14**

* Frustrated with his own grand Plexnet/Espra designs and the tendency of others
  to complicate that which should be simple, Tav wrote a series of posts to the
  OpenKollab and Espian mailing lists. Titled "[in favour of
  simplicity](http://groups.google.com/group/openkollab/browse_thread/thread/9f70d78556682f18/e541f9580167e325)",
  it outlined a potentially simpler collaboration platform.

**2009-07-24**

* John McCane-Whitney, Sean B. Palmer, Jan Ludewig and Gerry Gleason helped
  [figure out](http://www.openideaproject.org/irclogs/browse/esp/2009/07/24) a
  relatively clean syntax for transclusions and services.
