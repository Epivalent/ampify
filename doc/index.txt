Ampify
======

The Ampify Platform aims to allow for micro-data powered application
development. The goal for the 1.0 release is to have a fully decentralised
platform, but right now we're working on creating version `Zero`.

Have a read of the [ Zero Architecture](zero-architecture.html).


Get Started
-----------

You need to have Git, a recent Python 2.x and general dev tools (gcc, make,
etc.) installed.

{% highlight bash %}
# clone the source repository.
$ git clone git://github.com/tav/ampify.git

# setup ampify related environment variables using the ampenv.sh bash script.
# you might also want to add this line to your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc files.
$ source ampify/environ/startup/ampenv.sh

# use the new git update command which will now be on your $PATH to keep the
# repository updated from now on — it also inits and updates git submodules.
$ cd ampify
$ git update

# configure your build (and verify you have the necessary dependencies).
$ cd src
$ ./configure

# build various aspects of the ampify platform and verify everything works by
# running the tests.
$ make test
{% endhighlight %}
