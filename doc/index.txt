The Ampify Platform aims to allow for micro-data powered application
development. The goal for the 1.0 release is to have a fully decentralised
platform, but right now we're working on creating version `Zero`.

Have a read of the planfile for `Ampify Zero <planfile.html>`_.


Get Started
-----------

You need to have Git, a recent Python 2.x and general dev tools (gcc, make,
etc.) installed.

.. syntax:: bash

  # clone the source repository.
  $ git clone git://github.com/tav/ampify.git

  # setup ampify related environment variables using the ampenv.sh bash script.
  # you might also want to add this line to your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc files.
  $ source ampify/environ/startup/ampenv.sh

  # use the new git update command which will now be on your $PATH to keep the
  # repository updated from now on — it also inits and updates git submodules.
  $ cd ampify
  $ git update

  # configure your build (and verify you have the necessary dependencies).
  $ cd src
  $ ./configure

  # build various aspects of the ampify platform and verify everything works by
  # running the tests.
  $ make test
