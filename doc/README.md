This directory contains the documentation for the Ampify platform.

You can also view the documentation online at:

* [http://amp.espians.com](http://amp.espians.com)

The documentation site is automatically generated from the `*.md` source
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files using
[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site generator written in
Ruby.

If you want the documentation as HTML files for offline use, you can install
Jekyll for yourself using:

    $ sudo gem install jekyll

You also need to install the [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) syntax highlighter
for your system Python using something like:

    $ sudo easy_install Pygments

You can then generate the `_site` HTML files by just running `jekyll` in this
directory.
