This is the source code repository for the Ampify Platform which aims to make
micro-data powered application development super easy. The goal for the 1.0
release is to have a fully decentralised "[internet operating system]" style
platform, but right now we're working on creating a working proof of concept:
version `Zero`. For comparison, perhaps imagine a love child between Unix, IRC,
App Engine, [Xanadu] and Wikis.

For more info, please see the `doc` directory or visit:

* online docs: [http://code.ampify.it]
* mailing list: [http://groups.google.com/group/ampify-dev]
* irc channel: [irc://irc.freenode.net/esp]

Note: this is very much a work in progress and not much works yet — faster
development is dependent on your involvement =)

Enjoy, tav <<tav@espians.com>>
